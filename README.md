# dynamic-arrays
A simple analysys of how different implementations of dynamic arrays can be more efficient, resulting in a C library for dynamic arrays.

> **Note:** This code is *not* meant for serious projects and is done merely for educational purposes. It is heavily based on macros and can have inumerous security breaches. **Do NOT use this library for production code**. Use regular arrays or your own functions for dynamic arrays, that you can implement based on this code.
